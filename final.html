				<p><b>The Cut—</b> With the impeachment hearings underway, many women in the capitol, like Fiona Hill, Elisa Stefanik, and Joni Ernst have been victims of mansplaining from male counterparts. </p>

				<p>Mansplaining, a term first coined by feminist writer Rebecca Solnit, refers to the sexist way that <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/the-weaponization-of-mansplaining.html" target="_blank">a male will explain something to a female</a> that they full well already know and may even have more knowledge on in a condescending nature.</p>

				<p>As the impeachment hearings heat up, both male and female witnesses are being castigated. The question now becomes, how much of this is mansplaining and how much of it is just interrogation. Mansplaining is characterized by sexist aggression, so the term can often be misused or should be used depending on the underlying context.</p>
